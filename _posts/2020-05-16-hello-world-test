The brand new 4-wheel roller suitcase I bought from the Instagrammy company sits in my bedroom - empty, unpacked, reminding me of how far we have come in two months.

For those of us who live for travel, these are especially strange times. Even if restaurants and malls and offices eventually reopen, the travel industry may not open for a lot longer. What we took for granted even two months ago, isn't necessarily going to return to normalcy at the same time as the neighborhood you live in. I wonder when the flight routes to obscure places will resume, when the hotels and lodges will be clean and safe enough to return to, when the local medical infrastructure will have enough capacity to safely handle local needs and take on the additional burden of tourists.

The first moment I fully realized that I may not be able to travel for a while, I went through a week of feeling completely... unmoored. It felt like a loss of my identity, like I had to grieve over losing something I never even knew I had.

So I had a decision to make. Redefine my identity to be without travel, or find a way to make travel part of my life however I can.

And that led to my next question - **why** do I travel? 

We all have different reasons why we travel - some of us seek relaxation, some of us seek adventure, some of us seek new sights or tastes. I travel to seek an immersive experience that takes me out of myself, opens my eyes to a different way of thinking, introduces me to new places, foods, music and people.

Creativity is born of constraint, and so began my challenge to myself. The challenge to seek out a way to travel without traveling physically. 

We live in a world of unprecedented content creation - everything is within reach of a well-worded Google search, and in most big cities, we live within close reach of a vast diversity of people, experiences, nationalities and ethnicities. As an immigrant myself, I know how different and rich a diasporic experience can be, not *less than* but different from the experience of traveling to my home country.

I also recognize that when we travel, we take with us our nationalities, what we look like, what our gender is - and my travel experience is not the same as 

And so this is an experiment.

- To immerse myself - a city at a time, in no discernible order other than what strikes my imagination or reaches my inbox. 
- To find ways to see, hear, experience, smell, taste, feel, read and understand a small slice of a new place, to engage the senses and the imagination and to give direction to my thoughts. 
- To experience through other people's experiences a new way to travel. 
- To perhaps dig myself out of a rut and seek discomfort for the sake of learning.
- To find transportive moments.

My ask of you is to take this for what it is - a traveler's way to make sense of this global experience we find ourselves in. Along the way, I hope to find and curate content that gives me a transportive experience. I will try to find local content where I can so it isn't always an outsider's perspective of that place. I will look for readings, audio, video, recipes, activities, local restaurants, tactile experiences and will link to the original content every time.
